This set of python scripts are used to calculate the 2 point correlation function in the SpIES quasars. 
Still have some work to do, but here is everything up to this point. So far, we've only run with known quasars from SDSS, but in the near future we'll have quasar candidates to use.
The data files are not included and the paths will need to be updated for new files.
