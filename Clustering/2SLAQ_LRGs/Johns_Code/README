Instructions to use this code::

First run the Generate_cartesian.py code by typing

> python Generate_cartesian.py

This will convert the RA, DEC, Z from the input data (3yr_obj_v4_Sample8_nota01ao2s01_radecz.cat) and random (rand_LRG_Sm8_spe.dat) 
files to cartesian coordinates. The output file will be 'Cartesian_coords.fits'

After this, run the code Clustering_cartesian.py by typing

>python Clustering_cartesian.py

This will find the dd, rr, dr pairs and write them to a file 'Pair_counts_2slaq_small.txt'

This file will contain the smallest scale distances. To get the larger distances, run the files Clustering_cartesian_1.py, Clustering_cartesian_2.py,
Clustering_cartesian_3.py
These files will append to 'Pair_counts_2slaq_small.txt' and should be run in the order shown above. 

If running in parallel, be sure that the order is preserved!!

From here, run the code Landy-Szalay.py file to generate the plots of the correlation function.
